* Event Introduction
Artificial Intelligence raises deep scientific and engineering challenges in research and industrial areas. Google Brain has been exploring theory as well as application on language, speech, translation, visual processing, ranking and prediction relies on AI, and unveiled the star products: Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT), Google Assistant etc.

* Panel List
- Yonghui Wu (Google Senior Staff Engineer)
Yonghui joined Google in Sep 2008 first as a ranking engineer improving Google's core web search ranking algorithm. Since Jan 2015, he has been with the Google Brain team focus on deep learning and its applications. He leads the most recent breakthrough on Machine Translation. His research interests are in Information Retrieval, Learning to Rank, Machine Learning, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing. e.g. Google's Neural Machine Translation System.

- Kai Chen (Google Senior Staff Engineer)
Kai is software engineer at Google. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2004. He is currently working on applying machine learning to online advertising, and published impactful papers with Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng. His research interests are the Natural Language Process. e.g. Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space.

- Yuan Li (Google TL/Manager)
Yuan got her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer science from Tsinghua University and University of Southern California respectively. For her graduate study she focused on face and human detection and tracking with publications in top tier conferences and journals with nearly 2000 citations, and won Best Student Paper in CVPR 2007. Yuan joined Google in 2009. Since then she has worked on object recognition and visual search (Goggles, various recognition capabilities in Visual Search Service), Personal Photo Search in Google Photos, and currently she's a TLM in Google Research working on product recognition from real life images.

- Zhenghua Yu (VP of BOCOM Smart Network Technologies)
